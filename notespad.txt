    What I did:
    Found datasets, loaded them into my ADB, REST-enabled the tables. Created a directory for the Flask app. Created an initial app, copied some Bootstrap. Researched making a request with the Fetch API (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/patterns/javascript/#making-a-request-with-fetch)  

    What I need to-do: 
    - Create drop downs by year, and then by dimension
    - Create a separate "take the happiness quiz" html file
        - create a table for that, for posting to.
        - create a happy2022 table 
        - auto-REST enable the table 

   
   <div id="geology-fact">
        {{ include "geology_fact.html" }}
    </div> -->
<script>
    const geology_url = {{ url_for("geology_fact")|tojson }}
    const geology_div = getElementById("geology-fact")
    fetch(geology_url)
        .then(response => response.text)
        .then(text => geology_div.innerHtml = text)
</script>
